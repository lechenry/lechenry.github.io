<h4> About the Project </h4>
<p> When two unlikely friends, a scuba diver and an angler fish, get trapped at the bottom of the ocean,
    they must work together to get back up to the surface.
    Solve puzzles, avoid enemies, and get to the top before your air supply runs out!
</p>

<h4> Contributions </h4>
<p> This game was created in collaboration with Ava Giozoni, Julia Newberry, and Tess von Rueden.
    I helped create the title screen, player select screen, credits page, as well as the background art and parallax effects in the tutorial and main levels.
    I also made the breakable blocks, the anemones, and the treasure cut scene at the end of the tutorial.
    Lastly, I contributed to level design and created some of the player sprites that were used in the game.
