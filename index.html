<h4> About the Project </h4>
<p> This is a remaster of The Eagle, the first dungeon from Nintendo Entertainment System's The Legend of Zelda.
    There is also a custom level that introduces a new ice weapon that allows the player to freeze water tiles, freeze enemies, and create pushable ice blocks.
</p>

<h4> Contributions </h4>
<p> This game was created in collaboration with Julia Newberry.
    My responsibilities included 1) Player movement, 2) Room transitions, 3) All of the enemies, 4) Locked doors and keys, 5) Collectibles, and 6) Audio and Sound. I also helped with fixing bugs.
    For the custom level, I was in charge of creating the new level layout as well as creating the ice tiles and ice blocks along with their features.
